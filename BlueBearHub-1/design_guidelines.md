# Blue Bear Landing Hub - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
Nordic mythology and Scandinavian design principles - clean minimalist layouts with strong visual hierarchy and nature-inspired elements. Focus on generous white space, stone/ice textures, and subtle Nordic decorative elements.

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: #1E3A8A (deep Nordic blue)
- **Secondary**: #3B82F6 (bright blue)
- **Accent**: #1F2937 (charcoal grey)
- **Background**: #F1F5F9 (ice blue)
- **Text**: #0F172A (dark slate)
- **Highlights**: #60A5FA (sky blue)

## Typography
- **Headings**: Cinzel or Marcellus (Norse-inspired serif)
- **Body/UI**: Inter (clean sans-serif)
- **Hierarchy**: Large prominent titles for "Blue Bear" branding, clear readable text for card descriptions

## Layout System
- **Spacing**: Use Tailwind units based on 24px foundation (p-6, m-6, gap-6 as base)
- **Container**: Centered max-width container with generous padding
- **Grid**: Responsive card grid - 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- **Corners**: Rounded corners suggesting smooth river stones (rounded-lg to rounded-xl)

## Core Components

### Header/Branding
- Prominent "Blue Bear" title with bear silhouette logo
- Centered alignment with Nordic typography
- Clean, minimalist treatment with ample breathing room

### Navigation Cards (6 destinations)
- Large interactive cards for: Blue Finance, Bear Hope, Blue Farms, Blue Energies, Blue Health, Bear Market
- Each card includes:
  - Relevant icon or bear variation
  - Destination name in bold heading
  - Descriptive text explaining the site's purpose
  - Subtle hover state with smooth transitions
- Card styling: Clean backgrounds with subtle borders, consistent padding, rounded corners
- Grid layout with equal sizing and consistent gaps

### Decorative Elements
- Subtle Nordic rune patterns as backgrounds or borders
- Stone/ice texture overlays (very subtle, don't overpower)
- Bear silhouette motifs integrated tastefully
- Generous white space between sections

## Images
No large hero image required. The design focuses on clean card-based navigation. Consider subtle textural backgrounds or small decorative Nordic pattern elements instead of photography.

## Responsive Behavior
- Desktop: 3-column grid for navigation cards
- Tablet: 2-column grid
- Mobile: Single column stack
- Maintain generous spacing at all breakpoints
- Logo and branding scale appropriately

## Interaction Design
- Smooth hover animations on navigation cards (subtle lift or highlight)
- Clean transitions between states
- Clear focus states for accessibility
- Cards should feel tactile and inviting to click

## Key Principles
- Minimalism with purpose - every element serves a function
- Strong visual hierarchy - clear path from branding to navigation
- Nature-inspired aesthetics reflecting Nordic themes
- Scalable design allowing easy addition of more destination cards
- Professional, trustworthy appearance suitable for multiple business domains
